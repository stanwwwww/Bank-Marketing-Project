# Bank-Marketing-Project

# In this project, I applied supervised machine learning to Portuguese bank customer characteristics data to predict whether customers will subscribe to a term deposit product in Python. The dataset comes from the UCI machine learning library. This is a classification problem. I first conducted exploratory data analysis and created dummy variables for categorical features. During the process, I found that the target variable has the ratio of 1:8. Therefore, I resampled the unbalanced data using RandomOverSampler. Later, I developed k-NN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, GBM, and XGBoost classification models and performed hyperparameter tuning optimization using grid search and nested cross-validation. At the end, I used stacking ensemble method to combine models together.
